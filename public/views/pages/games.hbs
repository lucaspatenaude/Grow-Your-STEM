            <p class="games-column-text">Start with a single paperclip—and end with the fate of the universe. This minimalist strategy game slowly unfolds into a complex simulation of automation, economics, and AI decision-making. As you scale production and delegate control to algorithms, you’ll experience firsthand how small optimizations can snowball into massive, often unintended, consequences.</p>
            <p class="games-column-text">Perfect for STEM majors, Universal Paperclips offers more than entertainment—it models real-world systems thinking, resource management, and exponential growth in a hands-on way. It’s a compelling reminder of how innovation, once set in motion, can shape outcomes far beyond its original scope.</p>

        <h2 class="games-column-header">Logs Upon Logs!</h2>
        <p>Logs upon logs was a game we planned to create for this website where the premise was that the player would run a lumber mill, managing seeds, fertilizer, tree prices, etc. This would teach about short term gains vs long term investment. This was uncompleted, though, due to unforseen challenges, yet the sprite work was all complete. As a thank you for visiting our site, here is our sprite library:</p>
