      <p>Everybody likes money. Even if only because its apparently absolutely necessary to survive in the modern world. But from the perspective of capital, there’s only one thing better than lots of money: a stable investment. Investments may not grow quickly, but they must not fall or you risk losing everything. That is what having the US dollar as the primary global reserve currency is. An investment in America.</p>
      
      <p>To clear up some background, a reserve currency is a currency that is held by central banks and authorities as part of a countries reserves. This has benefits for the country and the stability of the reserve currency itself.
      <ul>
        <li>A country having a lot of a stable reserve currency can in turn make their own economy more stable.</li>
        <li>If a currency is being used as a reserve currency by many governments the currency itself will be more stable and will experience more economic activity and growth.</li>
      </ul>
      The US dollar is used almost worldwide as a reserve currency which indicates a trust and stability in the US economy. It also contributes to economic growth in the US as everyone is falling over themselves to have access to the US dollar. But what if the world abandons the US dollar for a different currency? And what are some reasons a country might choose not to use the US dollar for their reserve currency?</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Well, many countries may see the appeal of the US dollar because they see it as the most stable (and economically active) option. This is an important factor because if your economy is dependent on the US dollar, and the US dollar crashes, then your economy is going to have a lot of trouble. </li>
        <li>Another appeal of the US dollar may be that the United States buys a massive amount of goods from other countries around the world so being able to trade in the currency of America, if America is buying the most from you, is beneficial.</li>
        <li>The US benefits too, because of the incentive for other countries to work together to ensure the US dollar stays stable the US can afford to run much bigger deficits and accumulate more debt without entering an economic collapse (scary).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>So, what if, say, a new and unpredictable president comes into office and starts taking unprecedented actions with the US economy, disrupting foreign trade deals and, just as an example, plummeting the US stock market because he doesn’t understand how tariffs work? This instability might even affect the markets of our trading partners and cause them to reconsider the US dollar as a stable currency.</p>

      <p>The consequences for the States could be dire if the world loses faith in the US dollar as a stable currency. Losing the US dollar as the world reserve currency could destabilize the US economy and make it more expensive to trade with other nations which we rely on. But the position of the dollar as the world reserve currency is an investment in the stability of our own economy. And supporting that investment and ensuring it remains stable is crucial to maintain that position as the worlds reserve currency.</p>
