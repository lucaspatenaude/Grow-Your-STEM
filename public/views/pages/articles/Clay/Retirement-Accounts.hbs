      <p>For a young person in this economy saving for retirement can feel like a daunting, or even impossible task. Maybe you feel its unnecessary to start so early or that your career isn’t in the right place, but I’m here to tell you that if you have the money, no time is too early (or too late) to begin saving and investing in your retirement. For some their career is a lifelong passion project; but for many, retirement cannot come soon enough. There are many resources, different types of accounts and plans, and investment strategies to help you save for retirement. In this article I will go over just a few of them. Many retirement accounts have some sort of tax advantage over a traditional savings or checking account. Many are also invested in the stock market to help your money grow over time.</p>
      
      <h2 class="article-inner-header">The 401k</h2>
      <p>Having a 401k takes some of the money out of your paycheck and keeps it in an account which may be invested in the market to help it grow over time. The money is taken before taxes so you don’t pay any tax on your savings while it is invested. Some employers may even match your contributions up to a certain limit[1]. Taxes are only paid on the savings when the retiree withdraws their money later as income. Compounding interest on a 401k investment is a major benefit of the plan. In the stock market (under normal circumstances) your savings will grow exponentially, causing small investments now to contribute to larger gains over longer periods of time. Every organization has different options to choose from for investing. A 401k can be particularly appealing since when your money is invested pretax the net amount is larger and the compounding interest can accumulate much more highly when the time comes to make a withdrawal. Withdrawals can be made after you turn 59½ or before with a 10% penalty on top of income tax.</p>
      <p>It is important to look out for the annual contribution limits (when you’re paying into the fund) and the annual withdrawal minimums for those over the age of 73[1]. Some plans allow you to take a loan from your 401k and pay it back through your paycheck but you will lose compounding interest on the loaned money for the time it is out of your account and if you fail to repay the loan the money taken out becomes a withdrawal and you will have to pay income tax on it as well as than pesky 10% penalty fee.</p>

      <h2 class="article-inner-header">The 403b</h2>
      <p>A 403b is much like a 401k except it is designed for employees of tax-exempt organizations such as schools, government agencies, or nonprofits. Money is deducted from your paycheck pretax and put into a savings account where it can be invested and make interest. The retiree will pay taxes on the money as income when they withdraw the funds after retirement. A Roth 403b means that the money is applied post tax but you will not pay any taxes when the money is withdrawn. The same restrictions regarding loans and withdrawals apply as to a 401k, however according to Investopedia[2] 403b funds can have more limited investment choices and less protection from creditors.</p>

      <h2 class="article-inner-header">Market Volatility in Recent Years</h2>
      <p>As politics shift and our leaders discuss impactful issues such as tariffs in unprecedented and unpredictable ways the markets can shift drastically and, in some cases, negatively which can cost anyone invested with a retirement plan huge amounts of money. This may make the market seem like a less reliable or safe place to grow your retirement fund, and in some ways market volatility will hurt growth. The effect it has on your savings, however, is significantly downplayed if it happens early in your investment. Markets will recover and grow again after the source of the market upset passes. Trump tariffs, for example, tanked the market resulting in mass panic regarding retirement accounts. But when the panic caused him to reverse course the market returned to the steady fall it had been experiencing for his term before he announced tariffs.</p>
