        <p>For example, one source citing Bloomberg, pointed out that Spain has had a record number of hours with negative energy prices due to its large scale use of renewables like solar and wind. But how on earth could the price of energy go negative?? What does it mean for the stability of a quickly evolving power grid? And can we, as consumers, get paid to consume energy when prices are so low?</p>
        <p>The price of energy is all controlled, like many goods, by the ever-changing amount supply and demand on each side of the production. When there is more supply and less demand, prices go down. More demand and a lower supply: prices go up. This is why you may notice a drop in your energy prices at “off hours” like the early morning. Simply speaking, if it’s less costly for a company to literally give away money to get rid of their product then it would be for them to stop or lower production then prices may fall below zero. So, what happens when the price falls below 0?</p>

        <h2 class="article-inner-header">Your Energy Prices</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, you can’t get paid to use power as a consumer. The energy is first “bought” from the power plant by a utilities company which will sell the power back to you at a profit. The negative prices are “wholesale” prices, not “retail” prices, so the consumer doesn’t see as much of a benefit.</p>

        <h2 class="article-inner-header">Generator Consquences</h2>
        <p>If whoever makes the power has to sell their power at negative prices, they may want to find some cheap way to limit supply. Solar plants, for example, can be very easy to quickly turn on and off. However, a nuclear plant would be very expensive to turn off and back on again.</p>

        <h2 class="article-inner-header">Grid Consquences</h2>
        <p>When Spain’s energy grid crashed on the 28th of April 2025 these factors led some to blame renewable energy as the cause of the outage. At the time solar power was generating 59% of the total supply and at 12:33 CEST, in an INSTANT, almost all of the solar generation was cut out.</p>
        <p>The energy prices were slightly negative at the time.</p>
        <p>The idea is this: if the solar plants were automatically or accidentally shut down to limit supply because of the negative prices then it would cause 59% of the grid, a whole 19.5 Gigawatts out of the total 32, of power to drop from the grid in an instant, obviously leading to a massive blackout. This is pure speculation, and not a problem inherent to solar systems.</p>

        <h2 class="article-inner-header">What's the Big Deal?</h2>
        <p>While energy prices going negatively are not necessarily a problem with renewables. They are a symptom of a larger problem regarding the volatility of renewable energy when developed without adequate energy storage technologies included. Traditional power plants use rotating turbines which help stabilize the system by adding mechanical inertia. They also make a power plant very hard to quickly or inexpensively shut down. However, solar systems have no such turbines making them both very easy to shut off quickly and potentially disastrous if too much energy is taken away too quickly. The other drawback of solar power is that power levels can be dependent on weather and time of day. The blackout in Spain highlights a need for additional investment in energy storage technology so the power supply can be smoothed out and to prevent a blackout from happening here in America or anywhere else in the world.</p>
