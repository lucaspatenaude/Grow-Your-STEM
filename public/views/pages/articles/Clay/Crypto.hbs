        <p>Crypto coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown massively in popularity in the last decade, and some investors have been made millionaires! Crypto behaves much like any other stock in that you can buy and sell using the dollar and the price relative to the dollar fluctuates over time. However, there are some major differences which you should know about before buying.</p>
        <p><b>Note: </b>Because crypto is decentralized currency there are thousands of different cryptocurrencies out there, many with their own creator, culture, and communities surrounding them. Well get to what “decentralized currency” means later.</p>

        <h2 class="article-inner-header">Market Volatility:</h2>
        <p>Because cryptocurrency isn’t backed by any government its price can change much more quickly and dramatically than a physical currency such as the Euro. Also, because it’s in kind of a tech culture niche every time some famous person mentions a currency such as bitcoin its prices tend to spike quickly because everyone gets excited and buys before gradually returning to their previous levels. It is easy to fall onto the hype train of a currency after it has reached its peak and end up losing massive amounts of money.</p>

        <h2 class="article-inner-header">Decentralization:</h2>
        <p>The fact that crypto isn’t controlled by any government has historically meant it is much less regulated with much less oversight than a traditional currency. It also means that transaction fees from traditional banks could be a thing of the past, even though many crypto services also charge transaction fees, especially for international transfers. </p>
        <p>So obviously this can seem like a pretty great deal but it can also turn into very risky gambling very easily. Personally, more time is needed for me to be open to buying cryptocurrency in large amounts. It is a very niche hobby for some, and a non-traditional way of speculative investing in a market.</p>
        <p>You may be interested in buying cryptocurrencies just to find out what the big fuss is about. I only suggest you remember: buy low, sell high! Or at least try to.</p>
