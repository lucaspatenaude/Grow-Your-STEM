    <p>Your first paycheck can be confusing. You worked hard, but the number deposited into your bank account is lower than you expected. What gives? The answer lies in deductions—the various amounts taken out of your gross pay before you see the final number, also known as net pay. Here’s what those paycheck deductions typically include:</p>

    <h2>1. Federal Income Tax</h2>
    <p>This is the biggest deduction for most people. It’s a tax paid to the federal government, and the amount depends on your income level and the information you provided on your W-4 (like how many allowances you claimed). This money funds things like national defense, education, and infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>2. State Income Tax</h2>
    <p>Not all states charge income tax, but if yours does, you’ll see this deduction too. It works similarly to the federal version and helps fund public services like transportation, state universities, and emergency response systems.</p>

    <h2>3. Social Security (FICA)</h2>
    <p>This deduction helps fund the national Social Security program, which provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. You pay 6.2% of your wages (up to an annual limit), and your employer matches that amount.</p>

    <h2>4. Medicare (FICA)</h2>
    <p>Also part of FICA, this deduction supports health insurance for people over 65 and certain younger individuals with disabilities. You pay 1.45% of all your earnings, with no income cap.</p>

    <h2>5. Health Insurance Premiums</h2>
    <p>If you receive health insurance through your employer, you might pay part of the premium from your paycheck. This can include medical, dental, and vision coverage.</p>

    <h2>6. Retirement Contributions</h2>
    <p>If you’re contributing to a 401(k) or similar retirement plan, those contributions will also come out of your paycheck. These are often pre-tax, meaning they reduce your taxable income now and help you save for later.</p>
