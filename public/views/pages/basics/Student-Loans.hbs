    <p>For many STEM majors, student loans are a necessary step toward earning your degree—but managing them after graduation can be overwhelming. From choosing what to pay off first to understanding interest rates and repayment options, learning how student debt fits into your broader financial picture is critical. This explainer will help you break it down.</p> 

    <h2>What Are Student Loans?</h2>
    <p>Student loans are borrowed money specifically used to pay for education-related costs—like tuition, housing, and textbooks. They come in two main categories:</p>
    <bl>
      <li><b>Federal Student Loans: </b>Issued by the U.S. government. These often have lower interest rates and more flexible repayment options.</li>
      <li><b>Private Student Loans</b>Issued by banks, credit unions, or private companies. These may have variable interest rates and fewer borrower protections.</li>
    </bl>
    <p>You typically don’t need to start paying student loans back until after you graduate or drop below half-time enrollment.</p>

    <h2>The Interest Factor</h2>
    <p>Interest is the cost of borrowing money. With federal loans, interest may be subsidized (the government pays while you’re in school) or unsubsidized (you’re responsible for all interest). Private loans are usually unsubsidized and often have higher rates.</p>
    <p>Over time, interest can grow your loan balance—especially if you’re not paying anything during school. That’s why knowing your rates and terms is essential.</p>

    <h2>What Is a Debt Hierarchy?</h2>
    <p>A debt hierarchy is a strategy to prioritize which debts to pay off first. It’s not just about student loans—it’s a framework to tackle all your debts efficiently.</p>
    <p>Here’s a common example:</p>
    <bl>
      <li><b>1. High-Interest Credit Card Debt</b> - Often above 15-20% APR. This should be your top priority.</li>
      <li><b>2. Personal or Private Loans</b> - Especially those with high variable interest rates.</li>
      <li><b>3.	Unsubsidized Federal Student Loans</b> - Mid-tier priority due to interest accumulation.</li>
      <li><b>4.	Subsidized Federal Loans</b> - Lower priority, especially during grace periods or deferment.</li>
      <li><b>5. Federal Loans with Forgiveness Potential</b> - If you’re pursuing PSLF or income-driven repayment forgiveness, early aggressive repayment may not be ideal.</li>
    </bl>
    <p>The idea is to pay off high-cost debt first to reduce long-term interest expenses while maintaining required minimums on other accounts.</p>

    <h2>Tools and Repayment Options</h2>
    <p>Federal loans come with helpful options like:</p>
    <bl>
      <li><b>Income-Driven Repayment (IDR)</b> - Caps payments based on income.</li>
      <li><b>Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</b> - Forgives remaining debt after 10 years of qualifying payments if you work for a nonprofit or government.</li>
      <li><b>Deferment and Forbearance</b> - Temporary pauses for hardship, though interest may still accrue.</li>
    </bl>
    <p>Private loans may not offer these. Consider refinancing only if you’re giving up federal protections in exchange for much lower interest.</p>

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <bl>
      <li><b>Understand your loans</b> - Know the difference between subsidized vs. unsubsidized, fixed vs. variable interest, and federal vs. private.</li>
      <li><b>Use a debt hierarchy</b> - Prioritize high-interest debt to save money in the long run.</li>
      <li><b>Leverage your STEM income</b> - Make strategic decisions—sometimes investing beats rushing to be debt-free.</li>
      <li><b>Explore forgiveness and repayment options</b> - Especially if you’re working in public service or a nonprofit STEM role.</li>
    </bl>
    <p>Student loans can be intimidating, but with the right strategy, you can keep them from derailing your financial future. Want a downloadable checklist to help prioritize your debts?</p>
