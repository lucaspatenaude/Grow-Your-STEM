    <h2>Understanding Credit Scores and Building Credit</h2>
    <h3>What is a Credit Score?</h3>
    <p>A credit score is a three-digit number that represents your creditworthiness—essentially, how likely you are to repay borrowed money. Most scores range from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating better credit. It’s a key factor in determining whether you’ll be approved for loans, credit cards, apartments, or even job offers in some industries.</p>
    <h3>How is it Calculated?</h3>
    <p>The most commonly used score is the FICO score, which is calculated using five main factors: </p>

    <bl>
      <li><b>Payment History (35%)</b> - Do you pay on time?</li>
      <li><b>Amounts Owed (30%) </b> - How much debt are you using relative to your credit limits?</li>
      <li><b>Length of Credit History (15%)</b> - How long have your accounts been open?</li>
      <li><b>Credit Mix (10%)</b> - Do you have a variety of credit types (e.g., student loans, credit cards)?</li>
      <li><b>New Credit (10%)</b> - Have you recently opened many accounts?</li>
    </bl>

    <h3>Why Does It Matter for STEM Majors?</h3>
    <p>As you start internships, jobs, or grad school, a good credit score can give you financial flexibility. It can lower your interest rates on student loan refinancing, help you qualify for tech gear on credit, or speed up apartment applications when relocating for work.</p>

    <h2>Building Credit from Scratch</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Start with a Student Credit Card or Secured Card: Many banks offer cards designed for students or beginners. A secured credit card requires a deposit but functions like a normal card and helps build your score.</b></li>
      <li><b>Make On-Time Payments—Always: </b>Even a single missed payment can cause a significant drop in your score. Set up auto-pay if needed.</li>
      <li><b>Use Only a Small Portion of Your Credit Limit: </b>Try to keep your credit utilization below 30%, and ideally under 10%. If your limit is $1,000, aim to use less than $300 at a time.</li>
      <li><b>Don’t Close Old Accounts Prematurely: </b>The longer your accounts are open, the better your score—so keeping an old card open (even if unused) can help.</li>
      <li><b>Consider Credit Builder Loans or Apps: </b>Some fintech companies and credit unions offer small installment loans where your payments are reported to credit bureaus, helping you build history.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What is YOUR credit and how to make it grow.</h2>
    <p>Credit is a numerical representation of a kind of trust that indicates your ability to borrow money, or go into debt, and be able to pay it back. People who lend or give you money such as banks and insurers may look at your credit when deciding what interest rates or premiums to offer. If you have low credit, you may find it much more expensive to borrow money, get a loan or credit card, or rent an apartment. Yes, even some landlords look at your credit when deciding who to rent to.</p>
    <h2>So how do you improve YOUR credit?</h2>
    <p>Credit is built over time simply by being able to pay back all of your debts on time. If you have a credit card or pay your rent on time you may already be building credit right now! The easiest way to build your credit is probably to get a credit card and remember to always pay your bills on time if you can.</p>
    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
    <p>Credit is one of those things where the odds are that no one will notice when its good but having bad credit can have serious consequences. Sometimes stuff happens and your credit score may not be very good. You can and should raise it over time given you have the money to keep yourself out of debt. And being young or in school gives you more time and opportunities to recover from debts or bad credit</p>
