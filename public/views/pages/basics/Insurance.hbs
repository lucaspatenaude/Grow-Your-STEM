    <h2>Insurance 101: A STEM-Friendly Guide to Financial Protection</h2>
    <p><strong>Insurance isn’t just a formality—it’s a financial safety net.</strong><br>
    Whether you’re starting a job, renting an apartment, or just managing your health, insurance helps protect you from unexpected costs that could seriously derail your finances. It’s about managing risk—and understanding it early can save you thousands later.</p>

    <h3>What Is Insurance?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Insurance is a contract where you pay a company (the insurer) a monthly or annual fee (a premium), and in return, they help cover certain large costs if something goes wrong.</li>
      <li>Common types of insurance cover health, vehicles, property, income, and life.</li>
      <li>Instead of paying the full cost of an accident, illness, or theft, you pay a portion (deductible) and the insurer pays the rest up to certain limits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Health Insurance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Often offered through employers, health insurance helps pay for doctor visits, hospital stays, prescriptions, and preventive care.</li>
      <li>Plans vary in terms of monthly premiums, deductibles, and what providers are in-network.</li>
      <li>Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) or Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) may be available to help pay for medical costs tax-free.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Auto Insurance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Required in most states if you drive. Covers damage to your car, other people’s property, and medical bills in the event of an accident.</li>
      <li>Coverage levels vary—liability-only is cheaper, but comprehensive or collision coverage offers more protection.</li>
      <li>Your premium depends on factors like age, driving record, car model, and location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Renter's Insurance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Protects your personal belongings in a rented apartment or house against fire, theft, or certain natural disasters.</li>
      <li>Often required by landlords, and usually inexpensive—around $10–20/month.</li>
      <li>Also includes personal liability coverage in case someone is injured in your space.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disability and Life Insurance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Disability insurance replaces part of your income if you’re unable to work due to illness or injury.</li>
      <li>Short-term and long-term plans exist, often offered through employers.</li>
      <li>Life insurance pays out to your chosen beneficiaries if you pass away—useful if you have dependents or significant debts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why This Matters for STEM Majors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Early-career STEM jobs may offer strong insurance packages—understanding the terms helps you choose wisely.</li>
      <li>Lab work, fieldwork, or frequent travel can carry risks—insurance mitigates them.</li>
      <li>Being insured prevents one accident or illness from wiping out your savings or putting you into debt.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
    <p>Insurance may feel like an extra expense, but it's a smart investment in your long-term financial stability. As you transition into the workforce or grad school, knowing what coverage you need—and why—can protect you from life's unexpected turns.</p>
