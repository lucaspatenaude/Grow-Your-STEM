      <h2>Employment Benefits Beyond Salary: What to Look For</h2>
  <p><b>Salary isn’t the whole story.</b><br>
  When evaluating a job offer, especially in STEM fields, it’s easy to focus on the paycheck. But total compensation often includes a <em>package of benefits</em> that can dramatically affect your financial well-being, health, and long-term goals.</p>

  <h3>Health Insurance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Most full-time positions offer medical, dental, and vision coverage.</li>
    <li><b>Premiums</b> (how much you pay monthly) and <b>deductibles</b> (what you pay before insurance kicks in) vary.</li>
    <li>Check for <b>HSA (Health Savings Account)</b> or <b>FSA (Flexible Spending Account)</b> options—these can save you money on healthcare costs <em>tax-free</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Retirement Plans (e.g., 401(k), 403(b))</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>These allow you to invest part of your paycheck for retirement.</li>
    <li>Many employers offer a <b>match</b> (e.g., “we match 100% of up to 4% of your salary”). That’s <em>free money</em>—take it.</li>
    <li>Some tech startups may offer equity or stock options instead—understand the <em>vesting schedule</em> and tax implications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Education & Training Support</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Tuition reimbursement</b> for grad school</li>
    <li>Paid conferences, certifications, or online courses (e.g., AWS, Coursera, MATLAB)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Remote Work and Flex Time</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Flexible hours or the ability to work from home can cut commuting costs and improve work-life balance.</li>
    <li>Especially valuable in demanding fields like engineering or software.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Disability and Life Insurance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Short-term disability</b> can replace income if you're temporarily unable to work.</li>
    <li><b>Life insurance</b> helps cover expenses or debt if something happens unexpectedly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Paid Time Off (PTO)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Look at how much vacation and sick leave is offered.</li>
    <li>Some STEM employers now offer <b>unlimited PTO</b>, but it’s worth asking how often people actually take time off.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
  <p>Your offer letter may show a number, but your real compensation includes tools for stability, learning, and security. Understanding these benefits early in your career helps you maximize your future financial health.</p>
