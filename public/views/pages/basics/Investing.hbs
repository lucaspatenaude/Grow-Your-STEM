    <h2>Intro to Investing: A STEM Major's First Look</h2>
    <p><strong>Investing isn’t just for finance majors.</strong><br>
    If you’ve ever used compound interest formulas or plotted exponential growth, you already understand the core principle behind investing: money can grow over time. Investing is how you make that happen in the real world, often with higher returns than saving alone.</p>

    <h3>What Is Investing?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Investing means using your money to buy assets—like stocks, bonds, or real estate—that have the potential to grow in value or generate income.</li>
      <li>Unlike saving (which is low-risk, low-reward), investing involves risk in exchange for the possibility of higher long-term returns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Investments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Ownership in a company. Prices go up and down based on performance and market trends.</li>
      <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Loans to governments or corporations. They pay interest and are typically less volatile than stocks.</li>
      <li><strong>Mutual Funds/ETFs:</strong> Bundles of many investments managed together—great for beginners to diversify easily.</li>
      <li><strong>Index Funds:</strong> A type of ETF or mutual fund that tracks a market index like the S&P 500.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Should STEM Majors Care?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>STEM careers often have higher-than-average incomes—investing helps you make the most of that.</li>
      <li>Understanding data, trends, and systems gives you an edge in evaluating investments.</li>
      <li>Starting early—even with small amounts—lets you benefit from <em>compound growth</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Risk vs. Reward</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Higher returns often come with higher risk. Stocks are more volatile but grow faster over the long term.</li>
      <li>Diversifying (spreading your money across investments) helps lower overall risk.</li>
      <li>Investing is not gambling—it’s about calculated decisions over time, not quick wins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Long-Term Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Time in the market beats timing the market. The earlier you start, the better—even if you don’t have much.</li>
      <li>Consider using retirement accounts like a **Roth IRA** or your employer's **401(k)**—they offer tax advantages.</li>
      <li>Set clear goals: Are you investing for retirement, a house, or just long-term growth?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Getting Started Safely</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use trusted platforms like Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab. Many offer beginner tools or robo-advisors.</li>
      <li>Start small and invest consistently—avoid “get rich quick” advice or high-fee funds.</li>
      <li>Learn before you leap. Resources like Investopedia or Khan Academy can help you build a foundation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
    <p>Investing isn’t just for Wall Street—it’s for anyone with a long-term mindset. As a STEM major, you already understand systems, growth, and logic—skills that serve you well as an investor. Start early, stay steady, and let your money work for you.</p>
